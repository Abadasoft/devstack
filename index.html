      <ol>
          <li>
          <h3>Install Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric)</h3>
          <p>In order to correctly install all the dependencies, we assume a specific version of Ubuntu to make it as easy as possible.  OpenStack works on other flavors of Linux (and some folks even run it on Windows!)  We recommend using a minimal install of Ubuntu server in a VM if this is your first time.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <h3>Download DevStack</h3>
          <pre>git clone git://github.com/cloudbuilders/devstack.git</pre>
          <p>The <code>devstack</code> repo contains a script that installs openstack and templates for configuration files</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <h3>Start the install</h3>
          <pre>cd devstack; ./stack.sh</pre>
          <p>It takes a few minutes, we recommend <a href="stack.sh.html">reading the script</a> while it is building.</p>

    <h2>FAQ <small>Why did you do it this way?!</small></h2>
  </div>

  <dl>
      <dt>Q. Why a shell script, why not chef/puppet/...</dt>
      <dd>The script is meant to be read by humans (as well as ran by computers); it is the primary documentation after all.  Using a recipe system requires everyone to agree and understand chef or puppet.</dd>

      <dt>Q. Can I use DevStack for production?</dt>
      <dd>No.  We mean it.  Really.  DevStack makes some implementation choices that are not appropriate for production deployments.  We warned you!</dd>

      <dt>Q. I'd like to help!</dt>
      <dd>That isn't a question, but please do!  The source for the site (gh-pages) and the script (master) is at <a href="http://github.com/cloudbuilders/devstack">github</a> and bug reports go to <a href="http://bugs.launchpad.net/devstack/">LaunchPad</a>.  Contributions follow the usual process as described in the <a href="http://wiki.openstack.org/HowToContribute">OpenStack wiki</a> even though DevStack is not an official OpenStack project.</dd>

      <dt>Q. Why not use Crowbar?</dt>
      <dd>DevStack is optimized for documentation &amp; developers.  As some of us use <a href="https://github.com/dellcloudedge/crowbar">Crowbar</a> for production deployments, we hope developers documenting how they setup systems for new features supports projects like Crowbar.</dd>

      <dt>Q. Why not use packages?</dt>
      <dd>Unlike packages, DevStack leaves your cloud ready to develop - checkouts of the code and services running in screen. However, many people are doing the hard work of packaging and recipes for production deployments.  We hope this script serves as a way to communicate configuration changes between developers and packagers.</dd>

      <dt>Q. Why only Ubuntu 11.10?</dt>
      <dd>Supporting multiple distros (and even multiple versions of a single distro) is a lot of work.  DevStack is meant for developers and those who want to see how OpenStack really works.  While it is unsupported, DevStack is known to run on 11.04.</dd>

      <dt>Q. Can DevStack handle a multi-node installation?</dt>
      <dd>Indirectly, yes.  You run DevStack on each node with the appropriate configuration in <code>localrc</code>.  The primary considerations are turning off the services not required on the secondary nodes, making sure the passwords match and setting the various API URLs to the right place.</dd>

      <dt>Q. How can I document the environment that DevStack is using?</dt>
      <dd>DevStack includes a script (<code>tools/info.sh</code>) that gathers the versions of the relevant installed apt packages, pip packages and git repos.  This is a good way to verify what Python modules are installed.</dd>

      <dt>Q. How do I run a specific OpenStack milestone?
      <dd>OpenStack milestones have tags set in the git repo.  Set the appropriate tag in the <code>*_BRANCH</code> variables in <code>localrc</code>.  Swift is on its own release schedule so pick a tag in the Swift repo that is just before the milestone release.  For example:
        <pre>
GLANCE_BRANCH=essex-3
HORIZON_BRANCH=essex-3
KEYSTONE_BRANCH=essex-3
KEYSTONECLIENT_BRANCH=essex-3
NOVA_BRANCH=essex-3
NOVACLIENT_BRANCH=essex-3
QUANTUM_BRANCH=essex-3
QUANTUM_CLIENT_BRANCH=essex-3
SWIFT_BRANCH=1.4.5</pre></dd>
